# Introduction 
A collection in Java is a group of objects that are stored and manipulated as a single unit. It is an interface that defines a set of methods to add, remove, and access elements in the collection. Java provides several built-in collection classes such as ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, TreeSet, etc. that implement the Collection interface and provide different ways to store and manipulate data. Collections are used extensively in Java programming for data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.
The collections allows access to an iterator object, whose responsibility is to serve  every item in the collection exactly once.

## Methods 
Methods are used to manipulate collections in programming languages. Collections are data structures that hold a group of objects or values. Iterators are used to traverse through these collections and access each element one by one.

Core methods are methods that you need to have all functionality. If you don't have access to a core method, you do not have access to the functionality.
Utility methods are there for convenience. If you do not have access to a utility method, you can build it from the available core methods.Some common methods used with collections include:

- add: adds an element to the collection
- remove: removes an element from the collection
- size: returns the number of elements in the collection
- contains: checks if a specific element is present in the collection


Collections and iterators are essential concepts in programming, as they allow for efficient manipulation and traversal of data structures. 

# Conclusion
In conclusion, collections are an essential part of programming in any language. They provide a way to store and manipulate data efficiently and effectively. The built-in collections such as lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries offer a wide range of functionality that can be used to solve various programming problems. Additionally, the collections interface provides additional data structures such as deque, defaultdict, and Counter that can be used to solve more complex problems. Understanding how to use collections effectively can greatly improve the efficiency and readability of your code.
